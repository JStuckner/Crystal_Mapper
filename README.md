# Crystal_Mapper
Generates pole plots of crystal grains in a TEM sample to allow for easy tilting to other poles and generation of tilt series.

With the interface calculator you can find the tilt series to tilt along or across an interface. You can also set rotation to avoid tilting accross highly diffracting crystal orientations for a consistent contrast through the whole tilt series.

The UnknownCrystalGUI allows the user to discover the crystal type and orientation by inputting a few known pole locations.
